# landing-page
### landing page project udacity

In this project I used DOM manipulation methodes in order to create dynamic navigation bar, scroll to anchors from navigation, and highlights section in viewport upon scrolling.

Also, I used form elemnts in HTML to create a subscribe form.

I started from basic code that was provided with html and css that created a static webpage. I used DOM manipulation to make it dynamic.

there are a lot of areas to improve here, especially in design in mobile view.
